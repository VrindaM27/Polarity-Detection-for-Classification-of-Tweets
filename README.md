# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Twitter-data
A basic sentiment analysis on Twitter data by making use of the Twitter API and various other tools in Python.

In this project, I have extracted the tweets of a user by making use of Twitter API and Tweepy library in Python.I used the Textblob library in Python for performing text processing for sentiment analysis.I used the Wordcloud library of Python to make colourful wordclouds in order to identify the most frequently used words from the entire Twitter data extracted.I used the Pandas library to organise the entire data in the form of dataframes and for other data cleaning tasks.I used the matplotlib library for presenting the analysed data in the form of easy-to-understand,colourful graphs/charts.
